# Genshin Impact Damage Calculator

Hi, My name is __La Thieu Huan__. I'm a front-end web dev who loves programming and gaming.

In this project I make a web app for the players of the game __Genshin Impact__. Its __main features__ include:
* Calculate how much damage a character would do with their attacks in a specific scenario.
* Compare the results of different scenarios to help users select the best items among
their equipment, and somewhat the best team composition that meet their needs.
* Features helping users manage and save their data locally. 

I first started this project as a hobby and a place for practicing. Later I expanded it
and had it introduced to the Genshin Impact community on Reddit.

This repo is actually where I rebuild my completed app.
